VeuJS:
Homework

You have to develop an application that shows a list of beers in a table with 3 colums: id, name, image, actions [optional: filter by name and server side pagination].
The action column show two buttons: 'detail' and 'add to cart':
'detail' -> show all beer details in a new page and 'add to cart' button
'add to cart' -> add the beer to the cart
You have to show the number of beers in the cart in a counter on top of the application always visible (es: navbar).
You have to use Vue.js but you're free to use other external libraries as you prefer (ex: Typescript, Bulma/Buefy, Axios, ....)
